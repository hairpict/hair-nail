<p>Brenna December 7 2020. Due to the excessive sweat the nails are very moist. Move the tool around the cuticle looking for a spot where the nail will start to pop off. - They dont pop off when applied straight to the nail. Any polygel nails with weak bond strength will lift and beak or fall off the nail prematurely. Pin By Dannyrivas On Nails In 2021 Nails La Nails Long Nails.</p>

<p>Hi i recently qualified as a level 2 nail tech and i have started my own business Everything is going great apart from a few clients complaining about there nails popping off i have read other posts about this and people saying that they cant just pop off but i put a set on myself and a few literally did just pop off within a few days. Due to the excessive sweat the nails are very moist. For example try OPI Clarité. Yes acrylic nails can fall off on their own. This is usually when they have been on your nails for an extended period of time beyond their lifespan and the nail glue has dissolved or become too weak.
