<p>Skipping layers altogether will keep your hair looking full. Layering thin hair can leave you with stringy strands with no body or wispy ends. Even more volume for thin hair. This cut naturally flatters wavy tresses whether natural or. Long layers work for everyone whether you have straight wavy or curly hair. Pin On Hair.</p>
