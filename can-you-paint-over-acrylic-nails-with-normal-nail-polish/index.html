<p>The procedure is slightly different from applying polish over regular nails but I believe that painting your acrylics is easy and fun. You need to ensure a smooth and clean nail base to make the acrylic. They are both similar in looks but acrylics are usually more durable than acrylics. Whether you have just applied new acrylics with no colors whatsoever or with a pre-set design and paint you can repaint them over and over with no repercussions as long as you ensure that you are using the correct procedures and steps to keep their quality in check. Both acrylics and nails can be painted over with nail polish remover if you choose. Pin On Nails.</p>
