<p>Finish with a little hairspray. Once your hair is dry gently scrunch it or pick out the roots with an afro pick. This is the best way to deal with a cowlick especially when it is formed in the back. A lot of people also have a double crown. Ive never let my cowlick get in the way of my love for bangs but that doesnt mean I havent suffered for my stubbornness.

<p>There are lots of hair styling products are available in the market. Parting your hair down the middle should balance your cowlicks and will create the illusion of a smaller forehead. A quiff or pompadour is best for cowlicks in the front near your hairline while a crew cut taper or crop top fade is useful if its in the back. So anywhere where you see weird movement or bumps and lumps in the hair the main rule is do not pull the hair tight. Switch up your direction. Pin On Hair.</p>
