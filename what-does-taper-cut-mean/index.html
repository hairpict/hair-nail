<p>The main difference between tapered and slim fit is that tapered fit jeans are tighter fitting around ankles but slim fit jeans are tighter fitting around the bottom and thigh. Tapered jeans are cut to taper down each leg from thigh to ankle meaning they get gradually narrower towards the ankle. At about the knee the pants begin to flare slightly and may end up as an exaggerated flare or a true bell-bottom or just slightly flared at the cuffs. When tailoring jeans to fit better tapering has always been a common alteration. These pants are often worn with heels or wedges to accentuate a sense of length and for those with extra curves wearing dark colors is highly recommended.
