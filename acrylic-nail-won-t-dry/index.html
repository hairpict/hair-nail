<p>Then apply your nail polish as normal. No matter what I do she always has at least one nail that comes off and she always has lifting and gets water under the acrylic. You applied the paint thickly or are using an impasto technique. Apply 2 coats of Finish Gel 4 1st coat on 10 fingers and then reapply 2nd coat on 10 fingers. I prep the nails correctly I have a cuticle bit to clean the cuticle area and I wipe the nail with alcohol dehydrate the nail and prime the nail.
