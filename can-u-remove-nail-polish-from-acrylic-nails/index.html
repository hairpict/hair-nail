<p>How do you remove nail polish from acrylic nails without nail polish remover. Soak the nails for 3 to 4 minutes. Changing acrylic nail polish requires a different removal process to avoid lifting the acrylic nail but the right techniques are fairly easy to master. Youre probably familiar with the foil-finger technique from salon visits but remember. You can do this by soaking your nails in warm water and scrubbing hard with a brush until they are clean.

<p>You can repeat the above step until the acrylic is ready to come off completely. TO remove the acrylics you need 100 acetone and soak off the acrylics I believe. Normal acetone-free nail polish remover tends to evaporate after some time. Try not to get the polish on your cuticles because this may cause infection. Start by clipping off the excess acrylic nails and try to be as close to your real nails as possible.
