<p>To choose the best-suited bang style for your small forehead study the shape of your face and get a cut that suits your face and not one that you love. Truth be told five-finger-foreheads can be just as beautiful as their smaller counterparts. For smaller foreheads recommend that the bangs start further back on the hairline to give the illusion of a larger forehead explains Scarlett. With bangs you do not have the freedom to choose any bang style but you will instead have to go by your face shape. Go for thick gradually angled bangs that start at the center of your forehead and finish off in a taper around your cheekbones. Pin On Hair Beauty.</p>

<p>Instead go for layered side bangs to draw attention to your eyes and the middle of your face. An oval face shape is only slightly longer than it is wide making it the most versatile face shape for bangs styles. Go for thick gradually angled bangs that start at the center of your forehead and finish off in a taper around your cheekbones. You can rock any style of bangs but we suggest shorter side bangs that graze the tops of the eyebrows and end at the tops of the cheekbones. If you were to diagnose me you might say I have bang-nesia. Pin On Hair And Beauty.</p>
