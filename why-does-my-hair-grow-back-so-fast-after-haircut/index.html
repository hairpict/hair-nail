<p>So ill have that haircut i spent money on for like 6 days and then it gets. Unfortunately no your hair wont grow back the same way if you get your hair cut short and its much shorter at the back it will continue to grow like this and you will have to continue getting it cut until its all the same length both front and back. The benefits of regular hair trimming are to remove split ends and hair damage. Hair growth is also genetic some hair grows faster than the other depending on the person some environmental factors are included as well. Whether you are trying to grow out a style that you have grown tired of or want to leave a horrible haircut experience in the past you must have patience.
