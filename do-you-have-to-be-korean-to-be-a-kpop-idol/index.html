<p>To be able to debut as a K-pop idol you need to be fluent in Korean. They have to fit very specific Korean beauty standards. These idols however take it. International fans also have divided opinions. Many K-pop trainees and idols are Korean but its not an absolute requirement to be Korean - people of all ethnicities and races can audition.

<p>Not only do you have to constantly hone your performance skills including vocals and dance but you also have to take care of yourself much more meticulously than most average people. I Went to South Korea to Become A K-Pop Idol Backup Dancer. Many K-pop trainees and idols are Korean but its not an absolute requirement to be Korean - people of all ethnicities and races can audition. First theres getting your skills up and practicing for hours. I have fell in love with kpop and my dream is to be a kpop idol i am currently 13 years old i love singing and dancing and have been taking dance classes for about 3 years now even before i was introduced to kpop i know it is hard but i wont give up i still need to work on a few things including my Korean which you definately will need.
