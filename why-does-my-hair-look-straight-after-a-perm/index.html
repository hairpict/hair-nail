A sort of chemical reaction takes place with the application of solution which softens the inner structures of the hair. Maybe your hair is board straight or maybe you have really curly hair and you want more body and movement or more manageability. Pin On Hairstyles 2017.</p>

<p>One of the most common myths is that you have to wait 48 hours after a perm before using shampoo. I use a Demi permanent hair dye and I perm every 4 months. As a rule if you already have damaged hair you shouldnt even consider getting a perm. Perm solution when applied to hair penetrates the shaft and re-trains the hair to maintain the same configuration as when the perm solution is saturating the hair. Some sections of hair may be much coarser than the rest or a texture more difficult to perm resulting in the need to have that area exposed to the chemical treatment longer.

<p>This time is different for different hair types very individual but a good stylist should have some clue about how done the hair may be after checking one curl. It is a fresh perm and it cannot be washed for a few days because if it is the hair will return to being straight. The hair is therefore altered and can end up looking slightly burnt Using rollers can sometimes cause the same problem. But whether perms damage your hair will also depend on the condition your hair is in. If the product is left on for too long it can cause these bonds to break permanently.

<p>A perm can add volume and thickness to hair. We have always shampooed immediately after a perm to remove the perm solution and any residual odor. The bonds in the hair have been broken and then reformed in the curled shape - its permanent. Some sections of hair may be much coarser than the rest or a texture more difficult to perm resulting in the need to have that area exposed to the chemical treatment longer. It therefore needs to be undone in order to achieve the new shape. Allie Knutson October 2010 Permed Hairstyles Medium Curls Straight Hairstyles.</p>
