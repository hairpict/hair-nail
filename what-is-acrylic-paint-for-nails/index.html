<p>The water part of the polish is partially evaporated and partially absorbed into the fingernail. That means that the paint will expand and contract as temperatures rise and fall and will do so without flaking or cracking. It will smooth the design out and bring things to life. This mixture is applied onto the natural nail using a brush to shape. Even when the paint has dried fully it will remain flexible.
