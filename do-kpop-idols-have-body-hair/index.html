<p>By that logic they should be Gollum but they still have hair. How do kpop idols deal with body hairI got so many likes about this topic and also comments I had to talk about it. First Kpop idols make a lot of money so they may have access to better quality stylists it seems a bit of a stretch to say its due to coloring and bleaching. 10122018 And its true even K-Pop idols have to take care of themselves and even more so than others. Some idols dont even have body hair its actually quite common in asians from what ive read and others do shave i guess because their company tells them to. Pin On Sexy.</p>

<p>That is exactly the same for our beloved K-Pop idols too. Most idols dont have facial hair because its been known that a clean face has a more approachable and friendly look. Honestly its hard to do something about it. Literally first of all their arms are never hairy Like never have a caught a girl idol with hairy arms arm pits also its almost like they never have to shave their legs ever they are so lucky how do they have no body hair at all its not like they can shave everyday what is the truth. Body and facial hair therefore are something almost grotesque. Pin On Yang Saya Simpan.</p>

<p>The last time he had black hair was over a year ago. First Kpop idols make a lot of money so they may have access to better quality stylists it seems a bit of a stretch to say its due to coloring and bleaching. Sometimes perming ones hair would give so much difference to a persons appearance. This brought the envy of many others on the show as hairlessness is a desirable trait amongst idols.
