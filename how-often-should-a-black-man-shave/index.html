<p>If you continue to see razor bumps forming after taking some of these simple steps stop shaving immediately and consult your dermatologist to see if there are other measures that may be advised and helpful for you. Do a single pass shave using a safety razor only shaving with the grain. Healthy hydrated skin is far less likely to develop redness and irritation. A good rule of thumb is to shave your head as often as you normally shave your face. How often you replace your razor will depend on the shaving tools you use and how well you take care of them.
