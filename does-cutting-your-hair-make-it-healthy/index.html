<p>I spoke to several hair professionals to find out the clues you should look out for to avoid any hair disasters and that may indicate that its time for you to get a haircut even if you might not want to. I find most dryness along the hair ends and my haircuts aim to rid each person. Getting regular trims will freshen your hair and let you start replacing damaged locks with healthy new ones.</p>
<h3 id="gets-rid-of-split-ends">Gets Rid Of Split Ends.</h3><p>There is nothing you can do to your hair strands that will make them grow faster. Aim to get a trim every 6-8 weeks whether your hair is long or short. But just like the general rule for how often you should wash your hair this can differ for everyone. If you trim your hair regularly it will start growing through the phases instead of breaking off and taking longer to grow. This cant always be achieved you may not want to cut off that much all at once if you hair is very damaged but one big. Also if you examine your hair closely youll notice that it looks flat and dull near the ends.</p>
