<p>Choppy looks are sleek and face-framing with a bit of edge. Locks in the style without the residue. I tell my stylist I dont like it this way but it seems that it turns out this way every time and then I have to try to blend them myself at home which NEVER works out right because I cant cut the back. I use Schwarzkopfs GLUED hair gel to spike it. As a stylist I will tell you things to say and not to say to help insure you get a great layered cut.

<p>Wash dry and thoroughly brush your hair. I am used to stylists layering my hair by taking a chunk of it and holding it straight out from my head and then cutting it in a straight line - I think this makes it look more natural. This creates a texture to the hair to achieve that choppy look Wave spray. Then hold one lock at a time tilt your scissors inwards and give it a cut. Separate the portions you want to layer hold them away from the head and grip the ends between two fingers. Pin On My Hair.</p>
